# Workshop 1 - Data Wrangling in Python using DuckDB - 2024-02-29
In this workshop, we focus on data wrangling in Python using DuckDB. DuckDB is an embeddable SQL OLAP database management system. It is designed to be easy to install, use, and extend, while remaining fast and reliable.

We examine a case from Our World in Data, where we are asked to standardize the mortality rate per 100k people for Culmonary Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the United States and Uganda. In the original case the data needs to be found from three online sources, but in this workshop we have the fortune of having the database with three tables. We use DuckDB to query and perform the necessary data wrangling.

## Learning Objectives
- Basics of SQL querying and databases
- Understand the importance of data modelling
- Communication with stakeholders about the results and digging deeper into the data
- Issues with data quality and how to handle them
- Environment standardization and reproducibility (A good segue into Docker)

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Basic SQL knowledge
- A laptop with Python installed
- Downloading the [DuckDB database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AQqRqWYkT92apQ5uqFKCUfp97oU0uyv8/view?usp=sharing)
